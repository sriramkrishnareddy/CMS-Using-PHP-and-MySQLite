Developed a content management system in php. 
I developed public area, that's the part of the site that we want public users to see.
And it allows them to see subjects and pages that we've chosen for them to see in a read only context.
Here comes the admin area that has user authentication, which requires admins to authenticate themselves 
by logging in with a user name and password.
